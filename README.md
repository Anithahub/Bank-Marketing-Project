# Bank-Marketing-Project
Model to predict the subscription of term deposit. 
The dataset is from UCI Machine learning repository. It is a direct marketing(phone) bank data of a portuguese banking institution.
Analysed the campaign performance from previous and current campaign. Engineered features, converted to numeric and built model.
Since the dataset wass imbalanced with 88.7% 'no' and only 11.3 % 'yes', the model was representing or predicting only the majority class.
To address that, I did over sampling and did the model to imrpove the Recall score.
Logistic retession and Linear SVC was giving me good results.
